\title{Plot nodes on scatter plot}
\description{Plot a 2D scatter plot. All cells of fsom$data are plotted in
            black, and those of the selected nodes are plotted in red.
            The nodes in the grid are indexed starting from the left bottom,
            first going right, then up. E.g. In a 10x10 grid, the node at
            top left will have index 91.}
\usage{PlotClusters2D(fsom, marker1, marker2, nodes,main="")}
\arguments{
    \item{fsom}{FlowSOM object, as generated by \code{\link{BuildMST}}}
    \item{marker1}{Marker to plot on the x-axis}
    \item{marker2}{Marker to plot on the y-axis}
    \item{nodes}{Nodes of which the cells should be plotted in red}
    \item{main}{Title of the plot}
}
\value{Nothing is returned. A plot is drawn in which all cells are plotted
in black and the cells of the selected nodes in red.}
